# Fergus's Automation Take Home Project

This project has been created to meet the criteria laid out in the Focus Area 1 - Automation Fundamentals assessment. To do this, it was created from the example project provided in the Playwright automation documentation (https://playwright.dev/docs/intro), and was then updated. It now contains this README, which has been incrementally updated as per the requirements and is aiming to follow best practice for structure and content, as well as a single test file that performs a series of simple tests on the www.tombola.co.uk landing page.
